# Hello There 👋🏻

The CanSat program consists of the design and implementation of an operating system similar to that of a real satellite that is to be placed in a container the volume and size of a can. The mini-satellite will then be launched into the atmosphere to a height of about 1 km. During its descent it will collect scientific data such as atmospheric pressure and air temperature thanks to the system devised by the students.

The data collected by the satellite will be sent to a ground station, also made by the students, which will collect all the data. Then these experimental data will be examined and processed, and the conclusions will be presented to the judging committee and other participating schoolchildren. The team presenting the project deemed best will have the honor and burden of representing Italy at the “Space Engineer for a day” during a visit to ESA's Estec center (Netherlands) where European space satellites are designed.
